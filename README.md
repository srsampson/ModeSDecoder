#### ModeSDecoder - A Mode-S and ADS-B Decoder in Java for Windows and MySQL
This was written for the Mode-S Beast Receiver. This is a great little reciever that is based on an FPGA.

The program drinks-in the serial port data (ignores the Mode-AC if enabled) and creates data structures in order to decode the bits into values we can all understand, and use for a Database Application.

This is a hobby program I've played around with to store Mode-S and ADS-B data in a MySQL database.
